This project contains implementations of two data structures, LinkedList and ArrayList, in Java.

LinkedList
The LinkedList implementation is contained in the file MyLinkedList.java. This implementation uses a singly-linked list, where each node in the list contains a reference to the next node in the list. The LinkedList class contains methods for adding elements to the front and back of the list, removing elements from the front and back of the list and getting the size of the list.

ArrayList
The ArrayList implementation is contained in the file MyArrayList.java. The ArrayList class contains methods for adding elements to the end of the list, removing elements by their index and getting the size of the list.
